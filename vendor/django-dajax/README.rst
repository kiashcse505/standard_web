django-dajax
============

Dajax is a powerfull tool to easily and super-fastly develop asynchronous presentation logic in web applications using python and almost no lines of JS source code.

It supports up to four of the most popular JS frameworks:

* jQuery
* Prototype
* Dojo
* mootols

Using ``django-dajaxice`` communication core, ``django-dajax`` implements an abstraction layer between the presentation logic managed with JS and your python business logic. With dajax you can modify your ``DOM`` structure directly from python.
